What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.

To determine the best hospitals we will take a weighted average of the relevant measures at each hospital and use that to create a score. This scaled measure will take into account the following:
-When the measure was taken
-The score relative to the maximum and minimum
-The importance of the measure relative to other measures
